Hello guys!
I have participated in the Smart India Hackathon. We have cleared the first round of the hackathon but unforunately we were not selected at the national level. In this project I have developed the frontend part where 
I use HTML for structing web pages , CSS for styling web pages and JavaScript for advanced frontend development.
I have use libraries such as BootStrap and Tailwind CSS for UI design.
